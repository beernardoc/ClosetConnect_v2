## Setup

To facilitate the setup of the project, we have the necessary requirements in the requirements.txt file.

Also, we created a python script, "insertData.py" to insert some data into the database, so that the project is not empty.
The users inserted just need to be inserted in the Users table (Authentication and Authorization) in the Django Admin page, with the same username and password.


## Features that we would like to implement in the future

- Chat between users
- Notification system
- Checkout system
- Order history
- Search for products
